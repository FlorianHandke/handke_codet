      <description>This week I told Oliver about my first blog post. He said if it wasnâ€™t also possible for him to examine any text according to the principle that I showed in my July 27 post.
But of course there are! With R you can create webapps that allow an improved user interaction.
In order to realize the idea from the post, we will build a simple user interface, where the user can define a URL, based on which the text analysis will be done.</description>
