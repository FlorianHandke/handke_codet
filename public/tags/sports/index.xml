      <description>The ski season has just started. Therefore I was interested to know how the prices for different tickets are. So I compared and analyzed the prices of different ski resorts in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. https://www.skiinfo.de maintains a database with the prices of various ski areas in the categories day ticket and 6-day ticket. Each for adults and children.</description>

      <description>Last week I ran my first half marathon on the island Reichenau near Konstanz. You don’t win any prizes with 62nd place, but that wasn’t my goal either. Since the organizer put the results of the race online, I took a closer look at the data. I show the results in the following post.
The data I evaluate in this blog post are freely accessible at SV Reichenau.</description>
